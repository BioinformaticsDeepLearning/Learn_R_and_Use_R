#What is R programming?
R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display. It includes
a) an effective data handling and storage facility,
b) a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices,
c) a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis,
d) graphical facilities for data analysis and display either on-screen or on hardcopy, and
e) a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.

#Installation of R and R studio on Windows 10#
Installing R on Windows 10 is very straightforward. The easiest way is to install it through CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/), which stands for The Comprehensive R Archive Network. Once the download is finished, you will obtain a file named "R-3.6.3-win.exe" or similar depending on the version of R that you download. The links shown in the video above will take you to the most recent version. To finish installing R on your computer, all that is left to do is to run the .exe file. Most of the time, you will likely want to go with the defaults, so click the button 'Next' until the process is complete, as shown in the video below. Note that, even though I do not do so, you can add desktop or quick start shortcuts during the process.

#Installation of Rstudio#
Once R is installed, you can proceed to install the RStudio IDE to have a much-improved environment to work in your R scripts. It includes a console that supports direct code execution and tools for plotting and keeping track of your variables in the workspace, among other features. The installation process is very straightforward, as well. Simply go to the RStudio from this given link (https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#down. Once the download is complete, you will get a file named "RStudio-1.2.5033.exe" or similar. Again this will be dependent on the version. To complete the installation, it is as easy as before. Just run the previously mentioned .exe file with the default settings by clicking 'Next', and wait until the installation finishes. Bear in mind that RStudio requires that R is installed beforehand.

#Installation of R an R studio on Mac Os#
Installing R on Mac OS is similar to Windows. Once again, The easiest way is to install it through CRAN by going to the CRAN downloads page (https://cran.r-project.org/).

#Installation of Rstudio#
This process is essentially the same as in Windows. To download RStudio, go to the RStudio downloads page and get the .dmg for Mac OS (https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

#Installation of R and Rstudio on Linux#
Installing R on Ubuntu maybe a little bit more tricky for those unused to working in the command line. However, it is perhaps just as easy as with Windows or Mac OS. Before you start, make sure to have root access in order to use sudo.
As it is common, prior to installing R, let us update the system package index and upgrade all our installed packages using the following two commands:

sudo apt update
sudo apt -y upgrade

After that, all that you have to do is run the following in the command line to install base R.

sudo apt -y install r-base

#Installation of Rstudio#
Once base R is installed, you can go ahead and install RStudio. For that we are going to head over again to the RStudio downloads page (https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) and download the .deb file for our Ubuntu version

Hurray ! R platform is ready to use

Play with data................
